Install xampp
copy and paste the LoginRegister foldter to xampp's htdocs folder
Start xampp and select the admin uption of mysql
Create a database labeled logindb with a table labeled users
The table will have three attributes, id which is incremental, and the primary key, username which is unique, and password
After these are done, you can run the app (at least this is what I did before I ran it).
