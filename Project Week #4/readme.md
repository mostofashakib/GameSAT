1) Install xampp.
2). Copy and paste the LoginRegister foldter to xampp's htdocs folder.
3) Start xampp and select the admin uption of mysql.
4) Create a database labeled logindb with a table labeled users.
5) The table will have three attributes, id which is incremental, and the primary key, username which is unique, and password.
6) After these are done, you can run the app (at least this is what I did before I ran it).
